# Fitting analysis directory

Analysis scripts for fitting results.

## Configuration

- labels.yml: this is a fixed ymal configuration file where I specify the label name for variable name. (Do not need to change)!

- config.csv: this is the file I specify which fitting configurations I wanna use to do the analysis. For each set, a new row needs to be specify following the entry names listed as the column header.

## Tools

- loadFits.py: matching fitting result files for the certain configuration (load from config.csv) and reading, merging variables I want to analyse.

- draw.py: plotting 1D, 2D... distributions of different fitting variables;

## Main entry:

- analysis.py: where I do the whole analysis using the configuration files and tool files. I need to specify a list of variables I want to analyse, currently it will print the charge reconstruction and plot all 1D and 2D plots for thoes variables.
